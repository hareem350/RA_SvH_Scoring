Manual scoring of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) radiographs using the Sharp/van der Heijde (SvH) method is time-consuming, subjective, and prone to inter-reader variability. As RA progresses, accurate and consistent scoring of joint erosions and joint space narrowing is essential for disease monitoring and treatment evaluation. However, manual assessments limit scalability in clinical practice and large-scale studies. There is a critical need for an automated, reliable, and standardized system to perform SvH scoring efficiently, ensuring consistent results, reducing clinician workload, and enabling timely clinical decisions.
